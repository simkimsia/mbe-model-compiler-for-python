1. Modifiers (private, public etc)
2. Property Types (Attributes and Methods)
3. Use cases (Read, write, call, define) and where
   1. because there's no universal agreement on the necessity of modifiers, I have to explicit define use cases first especially for some one coming from another language that also implements the class concept
   2. attributes
      1. read
         1. inside instance method
         2. inside class method
         3. outside class
      2. modify
         1. inside instance method
         2. inside class method
         3. outside class
      3. declare
   3. methods
      1. call
         1. inside another instance method
         2. inside another class method
         3. outside class
      2. define
   4. where
      1. inside instance method
      2. inside class method
      3. inside class
      4. outside class
4. Underscores
   1. leading single yes for private
   2. there are other uses of underscores but all ignored
   3. will not use leading dunder for private
5. Attributes
   1. private instance (not directly writable outside the class)
   2. public instance
   3. Class
6. Methods
   1. private instance
   2. public instance
   3. Class
